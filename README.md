This is a typing test platform where you can check your typing speed.

I have made this complete website alone from scratch.
The UI and behaviour is inspired from already existing typing platform called 'Monkey Type' -Â https://monkeytype.com/

To start your typing test you just need to start typing the words that are displayed in the box and all correct typed words will be highlighted in orange colour and all wrong typed letters will be highlighted in red colour. You can choose between different timer options to perform the given task.

After the timer gets to 0 you will be with your scores on your screen along with two options -> Retry and Next

Retry option will let you practice the same set of words once again. Next option will provide you with different set of words.

The evaluating formula used for this test is : ((number of correct letters typed) * 60) / (timer * 5) I am dividing the numbers of correct letter typed with 5 and converting the your selected timer in minute and then after calculating the WPM - words per minute

So, this was all about the website and its functionality Now you can check your typing speed too.
